Conference: 2025 International Conference on Modeling, Simulation and Computing Science (MSCS 2025)
Status: Accepted (to be indexed by EI Compendex, Scopus, Inspec)

Contributions:
Proposed a hybrid forecasting framework integrating Random Forest and ARIMA, with focus on time series modeling and residual diagnostics;
Conducted ADF stationarity tests, ACF/PACF analysis, and identified ARIMA(2,1,1) as the optimal model;
Participated in model validation and results interpretation, ensuring statistical significance and practical applicability;
Received favorable reviewer comments with only minor suggestions on English grammar and formatting.
