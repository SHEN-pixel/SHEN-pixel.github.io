### **ToDoList App**  
**January 2025 – June 2025 | ByteDance**  

Built a functional ToDoList app with both command-line and graphical user interfaces, demonstrating skills in object-oriented programming and user interaction design.

#### Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented the object-oriented structure for task management modules.
- Developed both CLI and GUI interfaces to enhance user interaction flexibility.
- Utilized event-driven programming to support real-time task updates and state synchronization.
- Ensured smooth user experience through interface logic optimization and exception handling.




### **Lithium Battery Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction System**
**November 2024 – December 2024**

Designed and implemented a machine learning pipeline to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium batteries based on real-world battery performance data. The system supports proactive maintenance and optimizes replacement schedules.
#### Key Contributions:

- Built a complete machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
- Applied feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy using real battery datasets.
- Trained and fine-tuned XGBoost regression models to predict RUL with high reliability.
- Visualized prediction results and RUL trends using Matplotlib for analytical insight and presentation.
